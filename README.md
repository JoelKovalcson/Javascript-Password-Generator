# Javascript Password Generator

## Description

The foundation for this project was provided by an online bootcamp for [Full-Stack Development](https://bootcamps.vanderbilt.edu/coding/online/landing/). 

You can view the live project [here](https://joelkovalcson.github.io/Javascript-Password-Generator/).

This project's purpose was to create a password generator using primarily JavaScript, with an HTML and CSS template being provided.

Passwords generated on this website have to be within the following criteria:
* Length between 8 and 128 characters.
* Ability to choose between 1 and 4 of the following categories of characters:
  - Lowercase (a-z)
  - Uppercase (A-Z)
  - Numeric (0-9)
  - Special (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~)

## What I Did

I began with verifying user input through JavaScript prompt and confirm dialogs. Assuming all input from the user is valid and they still want to make a password, a password is then generated one character at a time until the final password is presented to the user on screen.
